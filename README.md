# TURN YOUR SOLAR ENERGY INTO CRYPTO
Solplex is an innovative passive income generator solution that utilizes energy from renewable sources to reward its participants.
By using energy from renewable sources, particularly solar power plants, Solplexâ€™s Proof of Generated Energy protocol allows for a sustainable and environmentally friendly reward program. It opens up the possibility for owners of renewable energy power plants to monetize their investment and generate passive income as the amount of converted energy is used as a stake instead of coins.

Solplex system is designed to be fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly, with low energy consumption. By using renewable energy, we protect the environment and contribute to the global effort of reducing the carbon footprint and global greenhouse gas emissions. We aim to promote sustainable development by providing an alternative way of rewarding electricity generators and the wider community. Our aim is to encourage new investments in solar power plants and thus directly impact an increase in the global production of electricity from renewable sources.

The wider community can participate in the reward program as holders and stakeholders. The use of renewable energy as a stake allows for the efficient tracking of energy usage and reward distribution and is beneficial for the environment and economy, as it reduces the need for costly and polluting energy sources.
